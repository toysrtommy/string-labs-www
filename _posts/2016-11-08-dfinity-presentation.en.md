Here's our DFINITY Announcement video (finally!) at Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai.

The presentation began with Mike Schwartz from our partner Boston Consulting Group, introducing the key challenges their leading corporate clients seek to address with blockchain solution. Then Dominic presented three major innovations
of DFINITY: 1) Governance by Blockchain Nervous System  2) Public/Private DFINITY integration 3) Crypto:3 protocol innovations.  And finally, Tom ends with a summary of String Lab's mission and commercial operations.

There were some production delay with the recording vendor of the conference, but we're glad to finally sort out and brought you the original video. Enjoy!
