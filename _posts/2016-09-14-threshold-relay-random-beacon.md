DFINITY architectures depend heavily on the endogenous production of incorruptible, unpredictable randomness.

Furthermore, we claim that all well designed decentralized systems ultimately depend upon such sources of randomness, and for this reason we cut no corners and seek the ultimate means of producing it. 

Listen to Timo Hanke, DFINITY Chief Cryptographer, explain how BLS signatures are used for this purpose. Foreword by Dominic Williams.
