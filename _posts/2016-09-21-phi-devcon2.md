PHI is an autonomous system that gives out loans algorithmically and creates a fiat-like stable cryptocurrency as a side effect - just like today's commercial banking system!!!

This 10 minute presentation is best viewed in conjunction with the <a href="https://t.co/g3Tsiz6zOX">original Devcon2 deck</a>. It introduces how, using an incredible String Labs innovation, one
day commercial banks may be replaced by autonomous decentralized systems.

No special technical knowledge is required to understand this content, other than an awareness of how autonomous systems can run on trusted computing networks such as Ethereum or DFINITY.

More in-depth materials will be provided soon.
