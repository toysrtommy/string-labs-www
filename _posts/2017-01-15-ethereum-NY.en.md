Bitcoin gave us a decentralized protocol that produced an indestructible, tamperproof virtual ledger. Ethereum took this further with a decentralized protocol that produced an indestructible, tamperproof virtual computer without backing servers that can fail or be meddled with. DFINITY is an Ethereum variant that extends the approach, introducing advanced new protocols that enable the virtual computer to scale out as new clients join the network: in short, it introduces decentralized cloud computing. Other innovations include decentralized governance via a "Blockchain Nervous System" system that can reverse hacks and continuously upgrade the protocol without dreaded "hard forks".
