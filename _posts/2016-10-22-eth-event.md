Ethereum Silicon Valley organized an awesome half day event at VISA headquarter in
Foster City, with excellent talks including Ethereum Mauve paper, Filecoin, State of SNARK
and etc.

Our very own Dominic Williams was invited as a panelist on Proof-of-Stake, along with
Vitalik, Vlad Zamfir and Jae Kwon, moderated by Martin Koppelman of Gnosis.

For those impatient, jump to 13:52 for some of Dominic's core thinking on scalable blockchain:
    "I believe that it will be proven with theoratical computer science, that in no way it
will be possible to create an infinitely scalable virtual machine without such (incorruptible)
    source of randomness" - Dominic
