On this Epicenter episode, Tom and Dominic shared our quest for building a massively scalable decentralized cloud - from the underlying crypto:3 protocol techniques such as Threshold Relay Chain that forms the basis of DFINITY, why governance issues matter, and how “Blockchain Nervous System” could offer rapid protocol upgrades without danger of fragmentation. Finally, they discussed why it’s crucial for private and public blockchains to be able to work together.

Highlights:

02:00 How did they get involved in the Crypto and blockchain industry, and the journey of String Labs

14:12 Differentiation between Ethereum and Dfinity 

16:57 Reasoning behind Dfinity building everything into one core system

20:59 How does Dfinity accomplish "infinite scaleable" cloud 

25:40 Proof of Work and Randomness in a Decentralized Cloud

38:34 Mechanics of Dfinity Governance System

1:01:07 Business Model of Dfinity and String Labs
