The blockchain industry have gained significant interest globally in 2016, especially in China. The City of Guiyang, China, is one of the most forward thinking cities that has listed blockchain as their top strategic priority backed by a number of major initiatives, including launching a 500M RMB blockchain fund, hosting global Blockchain startup contests, and launching a blockchain based financial product exchange.

On Jan 8th 2017, the delegation of Guiyang City - including its deputy mayor Mr. Yuxiang Wang, head of investment, and the cityâ€™s top financial and technology entrepreneurs, visited Silicon Valley for a Blockchain industry trip, and String Labs was honored to have been selected as one of the three companies for them to visit. The delegation also attended the Blockchain Fintech Summit of Silicon Valley, where our CEO, Tom, was invited to give a keynote on DFINITY project,The Decentralized Cloud.

We are also excited to announce that DFINITY project website (http://dfinity.network) is live!
