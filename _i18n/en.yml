    projects-phi-intro: "Today's commercial banking system faces critical challenges that it cannot solve. These include the vast costs of branches, staff, infrastructure and compliance processes, chronic bad judgement when originating loans that leads to hugely costly bailouts, and a monopolistic tendency to impede desperately needed socially impactful financial innovation. Imagine then if commercial banks could be entirely replaced with autonomous smart contracts that use algorithms and open networks of human validators to give out loans more reliably, and if this created stable, fiat-like cryptocurrency as a side effect."

Furthermore, we aim to participate commercially in the open ecosystems that we help found. For example, String Labs plans to be a major miner of the DFINITY network, and also provide hosting of DFINITY private chains for corporate partners."
