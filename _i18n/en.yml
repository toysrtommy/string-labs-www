    projects-dfinity-intro: "DFINITY is an open virtual blockchain computer and technology that extends and refocuses the Ethereum ecosystem for business. Innovations include open chain governance using a Blockchain Nervous System, private chains with smart contracts that can directly call into contracts on the public chain and Third Generation crypto and protocols that create a 20X faster virtual machine and provide a roadmap to infinite scalability."

    projects-phi-intro: "Today's commercial banking system faces critical challenges that it cannot solve. These include the vast costs of branches, staff, infrastructure and compliance processes, chronic bad judgement when originating loans that leads to hugely costly bailouts, and a monopolistic tendency to impede desperately needed socially impactful financial innovation. Imagine then if commercial banks could be entirely replaced with autonomous smart contracts that use algorithms and open networks of human validators to give out loans more reliably, and if this created stable, fiat-like cryptocurrency as a side effect."

    projects-other-intro: "While DFINITY and PHI are our headline open protocol projects we have numerous projects in stealth at any one time and work with partners in industry either in joint venture or consultancy capacities. Furthermore, we aim to participate commercially in the open ecosystems that we help found. For example, String Labs plans to be a major miner of the DFINITY network, and also provide hosting of DFINITY private chains for corporate partners."

    research-title: "BLS Threshold Cryptography"
    research-intro: "DFINITY, especially Threshold Relay Chain consensus, extensively uses Stanford BLS signature as a cryptographic VRF (verifiable random function) to achieve incorruptible, unmanipulable and unpredictible randomness to select block maker and validator groups."
    research-desc: "It's also used in PHI autonomous commercial banking system as a powerful way to randomly select validators for financial loans to prevent collusion."

    team-dominic-intro: "Protocol geek, coder and serial technology entrepreneur who hails from the UK. Dominic's last venture was an MMO that grew to 3M users and allowed him to indulge his passion for scalable tech. Dominic is a bit of a hippy, but once won prizes in Computer Science at London University."
    team-tom-intro: "Serial entrepreneur, founder of Blockchain University and previously a senior manager at eBay who comes from Shanghai. Tom caught the blockchain wave in 2013 and hasn't looked back. Back in the day, he graduated in Computer Science at age 14 and from business school at 20. Tom's a regular startup and crypto pundit."
    team-enzo-intro: "Enzo has built and maintained high-throughput computing infrastructure for several high-growth startups in Silicon Valley. He is passionate about cloud computing, automation, and loves to share his knowledge and enthusiasm with others. Enzo holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of California at San Diego."
    team-gustav-intro: "Cutting his teeth with distributed systems coding at Ericsson R&D in Stockholm, Gustav moved to SumUp, a famous European payments startup in Berlin. After realizing traditional payments systems were broken, he turned to Bitcoin. Later, he became an Ethereum core dev on the Go team specializing in security."
    team-timo-intro: "Once an Aachen University mathematics and cryptography professor in Germany, Timo caught the decentralization bug. Timo has worked on numerous crypto products and prior to joining String Labs invented and patented the famous AsicBoost (http://asicboost.com/). At String he works on Third Generation crypto systems."
    team-tomomi-intro: "A highly dynamic coordinator of String projects and business development activity, Tomomi was previously at the Women's Startup Lab in Menlo Park. She is a bilingual Japanese speaker, recently graduating Cum Laude with a B.A. in Communication from Santa Clara University. She proves you don't have to be a crypto geek to help drive String!"
    team-jon-intro: "As an internationally renowned and influential designer, Jon has worked for many, many well known names, contributing a unique and highly original sense of style and stunning visions in print, digital and video. Jon also once worked with Dominic to create a 'growth monster' MMO that reached 3M users. A rockstar of design!"
    team-shigeo-intro: "Shigeo is a talented cryptographer with interests in pairing implementations, x86/x64 optimization and machine learning, and the publisher of several academic works. He currently works with Timo evolving a BLS threshold signature library that sits at the core of the Dfinity 'threshold relay chain' system. A C++ rockstar!"
    team-henry-intro: "A founding partner at a successful Hong Kong law firm (specializing in corporate finance and capital markets), Henry was previously Executive Director of compliance at ICBC. His interest in crypto made him an early team member and a go-to String mover and shaker in Asia. Henry shares an alma mater with Dominic."
    team-will-intro: "Assistant Professor of Finance at Chicago Booth, Will Cong holds positions such as George Shultz Scholar at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and prizes from the Shmuel Kandel Award in Financial Economics to gold medals in international and national Math contests: a bona fide financial economics maestro!"
    team-houman-intro: "Currently a Professor of Law at New York Law School, Houman is a world renowned expert on law relating to cutting-edge fintech, hedge funds and securitization. This has led him to testify to congress on hedge funds and the financial crisis, and to the CFTC on Bitcoin derivatives."
    team-ben-intro: "Ben Lynn is the \"L\" from the \"BLS\" cryptography applied by \"Threshold Relay\" to generate randomness and achieve incredible security, speed and scale in public networks. Once a Stanford PhD under Dan Boneh, Ben joined the DFINITY team after 10 years in senior engineering roles at Google. Ben writes many papers."

    investment-title: "Decentralization is a massive movement and technology undertaking with so many fascinating pieces to it. There are already many startups, organizations and researchers working on different applications and advancing the core technology."
    investment-intro: "We are blessed with a unique cross-disciplined team of leading cryptographers, distributed protocols researchers/engineers mathematicians and economists. What particularly interests us are those complex cross-disciplinary problems, that could become the biggest game-changer, common building blocks, and enablers massively accelerating the whole ecosystem."
