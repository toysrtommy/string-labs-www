<p>—Dominic Williams, CTO of String Labs, was invited to present at Stanford Computer Forum on applications of Verifiable Random Function (VRF).</p>

<p>= Abstract =
We argue that a source of non-manipulable and unpredictable random values provides the most effective means to drive and organize decentralized networks and their higher-level applications.</p>

<p>We demonstrate this idea by introducing two ingenious systems. Firstly we review how a network can use a “Threshold Relay” system that applies unique deterministic threshold signature cryptography (Dan Boneh’s BLS signature scheme) as a VRF to produce such a sequence of random values, further exploring how a robust high performance blockchain can be built upon the framework.</p>

<p>Then we review how a network created using Threshold Relay can host “smart contract” software implementing an autonomous commercial banking system that applies generated randomness to give out loans algorithmically.</p>
